## Meta-Learning methods - An Overview
Final Project from the course "Deep Learning" @ Data Science & Scientific Computing, University of Trieste, year 2020/2021, written in Python using PyTorch.

## General Info

[Meta-Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_neural_network) allows for machines to "Learn to learn". This project is an overview of several Meta-Learning approaches found on modern papers.

The pdf report explains the details and the findings.

The Python program applies an SNN, [Siamese Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_neural_network), to the [Omniglot](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot)'s dataset, for one-shot learning.
